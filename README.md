# 🛠️ HTBPanel

**HTBPanel** is a terminal user interface (TUI) built with [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual), designed for interacting with [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) machines directly from your terminal.

Whether you're hacking on a challenge or just exploring the platform, HTBPanel makes your workflow faster and more efficient — no more switching between browser tabs and terminal windows.
